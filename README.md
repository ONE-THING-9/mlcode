i want to ready a train pipeline, in which i have a 
(text) and for each text i have multilable:
input_guardrail: yes/no
routing: Health, general, coaching
bye_intent: yes/no.

i want to train two model for this i want you to create a seperate script for both model
1. with cnn-lstm layers
2. take huggingface modernbert and train that with these option
  1. whole model, with lora, or last layer. 

So write the script fro traning and inference for these model. 
user huggingfac/pytorch library fro traning the model. make sure you write in simple language. and proper documentation
